# Project Euler solutions

Each folder is named based on the question number

* A `test.ts` file contains test cases
* A `main.ts` file contains the solution

## Development

1. Build all files in the project with `npm run build` or watch them with `npm run watch`
2. Run unit tests with `npm test`
3. Get test coverage report with `npm run coverage`

## Travis CI
Pushing to any branch will trigger a Travis build. This build must pass before you can merge into master.
